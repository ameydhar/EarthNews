A leading advocate is Gerard 't Hooft\nof Utrecht University, who shared the 1999 Physics Nobel for helping to\nassemble the Standard Model of particle physics (for which, rumor has it ,\nanother Nobel will be awarded tomorrow). He and I chatted over a lunch of beef\ngoulash and maize stew, and I thought you'd be intrigued by what he had to\nsay.\n\n't Hooft thinks the notorious randomness of quantum mechanics is just a front.\nUnderneath, the world obeys perfectly sensible rules. In the models he has\ntoyed with, those rules govern building blocks even more fundamental than\nparticles. You'd see them only if you could zoom into the so-called Planck\nscale, which, according to many modern theories, is the smallest meaningful\ndistance in nature.\n\n[More]\n\n", "source": "Scientific American", "publish_date": "Mon, 07 Oct 2013 09:00:00 +0100", "source_url": "http://www.scientificamerican.com/xml/rss.cfm?type=global"}, {"title": "Spilling the beans: Starbucks building giant coffee roaster and cafe at base of Capitol Hill (Capitol hill seattle)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/330126808?count=10&q=utrecht&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "author": "Jseattle", "source_url": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/capitolhillseattle", "source": "Capitol hill seattle", "publish_date": "Thu, 26 Sep 2013 01:58:00 +0100", "summary": "$57.4 billion global coffee giant Starbucks is making a massive investment\nwhere Capitol Hill rises from downtown.
