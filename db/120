According to the\narcheological findings, Idu was under the control of the Assyrian Empire about\n3,300 years ago, then later gained its independence as the empire declined.\nThe Assyrians reconquered the city roughly 140 years later. Researchers have\nfound artwork, including a bearded sphinx with a human head and the body of a\nwinged lion, and a cylinder seal dating back roughly 2,600 years depicting a\nman crouching before a griffon, according to NBC News. Researchers discovered\nthe name of the city during a survey of the area in 2008. A resident from a\nnearby village brought them an inscription with the name carved in it, and\nthey spent 2010 and 2011 excavating the area. Archeologists plan to continue\nexcavating the site once they reach a settlement between villagers and the\nKurdistan regional government. Iraq is home to several archeological\ntreasures, including Babylon, an ancient Mesopotamian city-state dating to the\n3rd millennium BC, which was discovered south of Baghdad by British scholars\nin the 19th century.

While this could cost 800 of the\n14,300 workers at Hanover their jobs, it's not entirely clear what Porsche\nstands to gain by the move.
