His work focused\non comparative government, including studies on totalitarian and authoritarian\nregimes. Linz was also a prominent critic of the presidential system of\ngovernment used in the United States and in much of Latin America. In his\nessay, \"The Perils of Presidentialism\" (later expanded into book form as _The\nFailure of Presidential Democracy_), Linz argued that presidential systems are\ninherently unstable, as they invariably lead to standoffs between the\npresident and the legislature, each with competing claims to legitimacy. Thus,\nas in many Latin American countries, presidential systems frequently collapse,\nand often are replaced with dictatorships. The one exception to that pattern\nhas been the United States--at least until recently. In an interview in\nJanuary of this year, Linz argued that the US was succumbing to the same\ndysfunction as other presidential regimes. In _Slate_, Matthew Yglesias\ncommemorates Linz by warning that the American system of government may be\ndoomed to an endless cycle of crisis and constitutional disintegration, as\nevidenced by the government shutdown. Dylan Matthews concurs, arguing that the\nshutdown is \"James Madison's fault.\"\n\n"}, {"title": "Noted political scientist, sociologist Juan Linz has died (Washington Post)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/331802897?count=10&q=linz&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "author": "Joshua Tucker", "source_url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/rss/national", "source": "Washington Post", "publish_date": "Thu, 03 Oct 2013 19:14:00 +0100", "summary": "Noted political scientist and sociologist Juan Linz passed away Wednesday.
