No one still knows that for sure, and\nApple won't confirm it, but CNN found\u00a0audio forensic experts that back up the\nAtlanta-based voice actress's claims. On top of her identity, Bennett also\nrevealed one reason why Siri sounds so snippy: \"There are some people that\njust can read hour upon hour upon hour, and it's not a problem. For me, I get\nextremely bored \u2026 So I just take breaks. That's one of the reasons why Siri\nmight sometimes sound like she has a bit of an attitude. Those sounds might\nhave been recorded the last 15 minutes of those four hours.\" Bennett often\nrecords dialogue without any idea of where it will be used.\u00a0\"When I first\ndiscovered that was my voice,\" she said, \"to be honest it was a little\ncreepy.\" That's because while Bennet is used to greeting people seeking out\nhelp from companies like Delta Airlines, she never expected to have her voice\nactually interacting with strangers.
