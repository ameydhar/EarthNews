Meejin Yoon has been presented with the 2013 Irwin Sizer Award for the Most\nSignificant Improvement to MIT Education. The award is named in honor of Irwin\nW. Sizer, dean of the Graduate School from 1967-1975.\n\n\nAs director of the undergraduate program in architecture since 2010, Yoon has\nbrought an inventiveness to the program in ways that are expanding the whole\nnotion of design and architecture within an institute of technology, according\nto her nominator Nader Tehrani, head of the architecture department. \"She has\nmeticulously restructured the pedagogy and sequence of studios,\" he says,\n\"\u2018bringing together a blend of architectural history, a connection to the arts\nand an equally critical link to science and technologies.\"\n\n\nAs part of her approach to that restructuring, she conducted a two-day review\nwith directors and leaders at peer institutions, as well as with current\nstudents and recent alumni, and insights from that review are now helping\ncreate an undergraduate program that is much more than simply preparation for\na professional degree, says Tehrani.\n\n\nThe curriculum is also being adjusted not only to accommodate the intensity of\nMIT's General Institute Requirements but also to capitalize on them by\nredefining studio content ...", "source": "MIT", "publish_date": "Mon, 12 Aug 2013 21:53:00 +0100", "source_url": "http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/topic/mitarchitecture-rss.xml"}, {"title": "Kendall Square initiative moves toward design phase (MIT)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/328555914?count=10&q=tehrani&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "summary": "This fall, MIT will select an urban-design firm to help it develop and\ncomplete a design plan for the redevelopment of Institute-owned property in\nKendall Square.\n\n\nIn April, MIT\u2019s rezoning petition for its Kendall Square initiative was\napproved by the Cambridge City Council following a three-year, community-wide\neffort to align the interests of a broad group of stakeholders around the\nfuture vision for Kendall Square. The Council\u2019s approval gives MIT the ability\nto propose up to 1.1 million square feet of new development, which will be a\ncombination of housing, retail, lab, commercial and open space. MIT also\ncontinues to have the right to 800,000 square feet in new academic\ndevelopment, which it had prior to the rezoning petition.\n\n\nBuilding on the work of the three-year community process, Ad\u00e8le Santos, dean\nof the School of Architecture and Planning (SA+P), recently led an informal\nexploration of design ideas for MIT\u2019s Kendall Square initiative with a faculty\ndesign group. \u201cTheir report focused primarily on important design goals and\nplanning principles that should be achieved in future urban-design proposals,\u201d\nSantos said.\n\n\nAlthough the concepts have not been fully evaluated to determine whether they\nmeet the financial, market, physical and legal feasibility ...", "source": "MIT", "publish_date": "Wed, 21 Aug 2013 05:00:00 +0100", "source_url": "http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/topic/mitarchitecture-rss.xml"}, {"title": "All that is solid melts into air: Tom\u00e1s Saraceno visits MIT (MIT)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/328555793?count=10&q=tehrani&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "summary": "\"It's 99.9 percent air,\" says artist Tom\u00e1s Saraceno of his latest work, \"On\nSpace Time Foam.\" On Space Time Foam is a multi-layered habitat of diaphanous\nmembranes suspended 24 meters above the ground, its form continuously shaping\nand shaped by the actions of those who dare be enfolded within the billows and\nwrinkles of its inflated topography.\n\n\nWhat steel was to the cities of the 20th century, perhaps air will be to those\nof the new millennium.
