They had a\njust cause--the government of Laurent Gbagbo, with the help of armed youth\ngangs from the Christian south, was pursuing a policy of anti-northern, anti-\nMuslim discrimination that had genocidal overtones--but they didn't inspire\nmuch confidence. Stuck behind a U.N. ceasefire line that was patrolled by\nFrench and West African troops, the rebels spent their ample free time getting\ndrunk, boasting about their prowess, and committing acts of petty banditry.\nThey drove around armed in pickup trucks, with Spider-Man logos and names like\n\"Delta Force\" painted on the sides.

They analysed a dataset from one of the country's largest mobile\noperators containing caller IDs, the cell towers used for each call and the\ntime and amount of all airtime purchases. The researchers say an individual's\nairtime buying habits are a good proxy for his or her income. As a result,\nthey were able to to map wealth across the entire country. Their map clearly\nshows the wealthy cities such as Abidjan, the largest seaport in West Africa.\nBut it also shows an unexpectedly wealthy region in the conflict-ridden area\nthat borders Liberia.
