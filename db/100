Apple's funny rainbow logo had the words \"apple computer\" scrawled\nacross in an ugly typeface. As for product design, it looked like a clunky old\ntypewriter without its ribbon and roller, and the keyboard stood at a wildly\nnon-ergonomic height above the desktop. Two primitive 5 \u00bc-inch floppy disk\ndrives made of generic sheet metal rested on top of the computer case, capped\nby an off-the-shelf Japanese monitor that displayed green characters on a\nblack background. The Apple IIe clearly fell short of a grand vision, but I\ndecided to buy one anyway. And as I played with my nice toy it dawned on me\nthat computers--or \"thinking machines\"--were destined to enter our daily\nlives.\n\nRead Full Story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"title": "Digital Chocolate, Which Nurtured Some Of Gaming's Best Talent, Sells Its Barcelona Studio To Ubisoft (Techcrunch)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/328424058?count=10&q=helsinki&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "author": "Kim-Mai Cutler", "source_url": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/Techcrunch", "source": "Techcrunch", "publish_date": "Tue, 24 Sep 2013 00:42:00 +0100", "summary": "Digital Chocolate, the long-troubled gaming company from original EA founder\nTrip Hawkins, has sold its 46-person Barcelona studio to France's Ubisoft. The\nsale comes just months after the company closed down its Helsinki office.\nUbisoft confirmed the acquisition to us and Digital Chocolate has yet to\nrespond to immediate requests for comment. Ubisoft is picking up all of\nDigital Chocolate Spain's\u00a0technologies and brands, but they're not acquiring\nany of the company's other studios. The company has been downsizing for more\nthan a year, with layoffs and Hawkins stepping down in 2012 to form a new\neducational gaming company. It's another tough chapter for the 10-year-old\ncompany, which has raised at least $55 million to date in four separate\nventure rounds. Somewhat Ironically, even though Digital Chocolate had trouble\nfinding its footing on emerging gaming platforms like Facebook and iOS, the\ncompany has nurtured some of the industry's best talent. Former Digital\nChocolate Helsinki head Ilkka Paananen, for example, went on to co-found and\nrun one of the world's most lucrative iOS gaming companies, Supercell.
