Gomez\nwas expected to perform in Minsk, Belarus and Kiev, Ukraine this weekend and\nin St. Petersburg and Moscow next week. Russian authorities did not specify\nwhy Gomez was refused a visa, but this action comes as some authorities are\naggressively enforcing laws banning gay-rights propaganda. This past summer,\nRussian officials threatened to prosecute Lady Gaga and Madonna for advocating\ngay rights during their performances; earlier this month, Cher declined an\ninvitation to perform at the Sochi Olympics in protest of the anti-gay law.\nGay rights activist John Becker launched a Change.org petition imploring Gomez\nto \"stand up for Russia's LGBT community\" while touring \u2014 the startlet's visa\nwas reportedly denied soon after the petition went live. The petition\ncurrently has more than 13,000 signatures.\n\n"}, {"title": "Hipster Assimilation: The World\u2019s 10 Most Brooklynish Restaurants and Bars (nymag)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/333044637?count=10&q=minsk&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "author": "Adam K.
