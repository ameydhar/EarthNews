They are as different from prior generations as were Baby\nBoomers who grew up with the first televisions, and earlier generations who\ngrew up with the very first cars or electricity. They have never really known\na world without Internet, mobile devices or social media.\n\n"}, {"title": "Southern gent pens 'Southern Fried' (Knoxville News Sentinel)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/334538435?count=10&q=gent&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "author": "ConstantineM@knoxnews.com (Mary Constantine)", "source_url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/rss/headlines/archives/", "source": "Knoxville News Sentinel", "publish_date": "Wed, 16 Oct 2013 23:33:00 +0100", "summary": "James Villas serves up easy and delicious recipes in 'Southern Fried.\"\n\n"}, {"title": "Nvidia supercomputer building blocks revealed (TechEye)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/328614905?count=10&q=gent&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "author": "A Staff Writer", "source_url": "http://www.techeye.net/product/acrobat-reader/feed", "source": "TechEye", "publish_date": "Fri, 13 Jan 2012 16:45:00 +0100", "summary": "While CES 2012 was at full blast and all eyes were centred on smart TV,\nsmartphone and tablet goodies, details of Nvidia\u2019s Echelon supercomputer chip\nhave resurfaced a few weeks after Supercomputing 2011.\n\n"}, {"title": "Benedict Cumberatch Beaten & Covered In Blood In Latest Little Favour Trailer (WATCH) (Entertainment Wise)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/334669835?count=10&q=gent&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "summary": "British Actor Is A Far Cry From His Usual Dapper Roles\n\n", "source": "Entertainment Wise", "publish_date": "Thu, 17 Oct 2013 13:47:00 +0100", "source_url": "http://www.entertainmentwise.com/rss/news.rss"}, {"title": "Fran\u2019s Got a Man!
