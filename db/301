The bust was made Sept. 11. The drugs\nwere smuggled in 30 suitcases and stashed and registered under phony names\nthat were not listed among passengers on the flight going to Charles DeGaulle\nAirport. Air France officials are still trying to determine how the drugs --\nwith a possible street value of more than $270 million -- got onto the\nairplane. \"This marks the biggest seizure of cocaine ever made in mainland\nFrance as part of a judicial investigation,\" French Interior Minister Manuel\nValls told reporters. U.S. drug enforcement officials have accused Venezuela\nof being lax in cracking down on drug smuggling and Caracas has long been a\nmajor hub.
