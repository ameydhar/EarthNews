A couple of years\nago, after being tapped by Hannibal's Copenhagen-based electronic group\nQuadron, producer/vocalist Mike Milosh\u00a0flew to Denmark to work with the group\nand they hit it off. Eventually, Quadron producer Robin Hannibal moved to L.A.\nin pursuit of a woman, and Milosh coincidentally relocated there as well, and\nstarted his own serious relationship (which has since evolved into a marriage)\nbefore they reconnected musically.\n\nFrom what Milosh has said, Rhye's primary goal is to pay tribute to this type\nof world-tilting romantic experience, but so far the pair have delivered their\ninterpretations of this very personal phenomenon from behind a veil of\nsecrecy. They released their first single, \"Open\", anonymously, and promoted\nit in a deliberately opaque fashion, like a YouTube video of Milosh serenading\nhis wife with a solo piano rendition of the song, shot in a way where you can\nbarely make him out in silhouette. Even after revealing their identities, the\npair refuse to say where the group's name comes from or what it means, and\ntheir full names don't appear anywhere in the liner notes to their debut\nalbum, _Woman_.\n\nEven without ..."}, {"title": "Iceage: You're Nothing (PitchforkBestNewAlbums)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/328580048?count=10&q=copenhagen&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "author": "Brandon Stosuy", "source_url": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/PitchforkBestNewAlbums", "source": "PitchforkBestNewAlbums", "publish_date": "Mon, 18 Feb 2013 07:00:00 +0100", "summary": "When Iceage released their excellent 2011 debut, _New Brigade_, a large part\nof the discussion was dedicated to the nihilistic but crush-worthy Danish punk\ngroup's ages (at the time, ranging from 18 to 19), and the fact that they\nsounded much older than that. You also got stories about their bloody live\nshows and, later, online handwringing about them baiting controversy Joy\nDivision-style by apparently\u00a0flirting with fascist gestures at one of those\nshows. In the beginning, though, people were most interested in the part about\nfour young dudes exploding out of \"nowhere\" (the Copenhagen DIY scene) fully\nformed and going on to release one of the best punk collections in recent\nmemory. Their shows during that time were powerful in a very messy, very punk\nway. Two years later, they're a different band, one capable of more than\nshambling atmospherics and stage dives. Iceage write brilliant songs; on\n_You're Nothing_, they've found a way to clarify these compositional skills\nwithout stripping away their power.\n\nIceage's self-produced second album is even better than their debut.
