They're grappling with the digital transition -- which,\ndepending on where you live, has either already arrived or is about to come\nknocking. They're battling for readers' eyeballs, trying to make books stand\nout in a sea of other forms of entertainment. And they're figuring out how to\nprice their digital content.\n\nThese themes were major topics of discussion at the 2013 Frankfurt Book Fair,\nwhich brings over 200,000 book trade professionals to Germany each fall and\ntook place this week. Here's a roundup of the best coverage and biggest trends\nfrom the fair.\n\n## International ebook markets: What's the same, what's different\n\nBy next year, more than half of all books sold in the U.S. will be purchased\nonline rather than in stores. Russ Grandinetti, Amazon's VP of Kindle Content,\nsaid at the Publishers Launch Frankfurt conference that \"the U.K. is only\nanother year away\" from hitting the 50 percent mark, \"and he believes the same\ntrend is 'not more than three years' away for most of 'the rest of Europe.\"\n\nGrandinetti also said that markets outside the U.S. will ..."}, {"title": "Connection (RoundThoughts)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/334620260?count=10&q=frankfurt&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "author": "Roy Siny", "source_url": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/RoundThoughts", "source": "RoundThoughts", "publish_date": "Wed, 16 Oct 2013 16:45:00 +0100", "summary": "Democracy is the key to a good connection between a management of a club and\nits fans\n\n"}, {"title": "Ebook subscriptions: Oyster expands to iPad and opens to all; some stats from Scribd (paidcontent)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/334431572?count=10&q=frankfurt&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "author": "Laura Hazard Owen", "source_url": "http://feeds.moconews.net/moconews/", "source": "paidcontent", "publish_date": "Wed, 16 Oct 2013 14:00:00 +0100", "summary": "Oyster, the Peter Thiel-backed startup that aims to be a Netflix for ebooks,\nwas iPhone-only and invite-only for its first six weeks. On Wednesday, though,\nOyster launched its iPad app and opened up to everyone. And it is now offering\na free 30-day trial of its service -- which is essential, since consumers are\nstill very unfamiliar with ebook subscription services.\n\nWhen I reviewed Oyster six weeks ago, I was impressed by its design and its\nofferings -- over 100,000 in-copyright ebooks for $9.95 a month. But I thought\nthe app's lack of availability on iPad was a big drawback because I think it's\nhard to do serious reading on an iPhone. The launch on iPad remedies this\nproblem, of course, and subscribers' books will sync between both devices.\n\nOyster's design on iPad is great, just as the iPhone app design is. One\nfeature I liked is that you can tap to turn pages on the iPad app -- it's a\ngesture that anyone who's used a touchscreen e-reader should be familiar with,\nand it's easier than swiping.\n\nOyster CEO Eric Stromberg and cofounder and chief product developer Willem Van\nLancker wouldn't tell me how ..."}, {"title": "Government Shuts Down, Nation Descends into Riots, Looting and Cannibalism (fpm)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/331272929?count=10&q=frankfurt&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "author": "Daniel Greenfield", "source_url": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/fpm", "source": "fpm", "publish_date": "Tue, 01 Oct 2013 14:35:00 +0100", "summary": "n Caplow City, Maine, President Gerald Ford, long thought dead and believed to\nhave been buried in Michigan, appeared and declared himself to be the nation's\nnew leader.\n\n"}, {"title": "Merkel concludes campaign trying to fend off Eurosceptic threat (Reuters)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/328322088?count=10&q=frankfurt&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "summary": "BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Angela Merkel wrapped up her re-election campaign\non Saturday with an appeal to defend Europe and her center-right coalition\nagainst Eurosceptics who threaten to break into the German parliament for the\nfirst time in Sunday's election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "source": "Reuters", "publish_date": "Sat, 21 Sep 2013 14:28:00 +0100", "source_url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/worldNews"}, {"title": "Insight: Europe's bold vision hits trouble (Reuters)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/334897665?count=10&q=frankfurt&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "summary": "BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Barely a year after European leaders set out an\nambitious vision for the euro zone's future, progress has all but stalled and\npressure is building for what may amount to a 'make or break' moment for the\nunion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "source": "Reuters", "publish_date": "Fri, 18 Oct 2013 11:45:00 +0100", "source_url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/worldNews"}, {"title": "Merkel looks left to rescue Germany's energy revolution (Reuters)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/330159546?count=10&q=frankfurt&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "summary": "BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Angela Merkel's best hope of saving her bold\nenergy revolution may lie in a coalition with the center-left Social Democrats\n(SPD), who could agree to modest cuts to costly incentives for green power\nwhich are, paradoxically, driving up energy prices.\n\n", "source": "Reuters", "publish_date": "Thu, 26 Sep 2013 07:16:00 +0100", "source_url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/worldNews"}, {"title": "The Hottest Cars From the Frankfurt Auto Show (Wall Street Journal)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/330718200?count=10&q=frankfurt&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "summary": "Premium automakers outdo each other at the Frankfurt Auto Show in Germany.
