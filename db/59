One of his main concerns is better integrating suburbs with\nthe larger metropolitan areas in which they exist.\n\n\n\nAlexander D\u2019Hooghe, and associate professor of architecture and director of\nthe Center for Advanced Urbanism at MIT. Photo: M. Scott Brauer\n\n\n\u201cThe future of our cities is in the gradual densification of our suburbs,\u201d\nD\u2019Hooghe says. After all, he thinks, not all suburbs have to take the form of\nsprawling tracts: \u201cWe need to do some myth-busting about that.\u201d Instead,\nD\u2019Hooghe believes, suburban areas can have better-designed public and\ncommercial spaces, and better transit hubs, if we\u2019re willing to make a few\nchanges to them.\n\n\nFor instance, take the big box, that often-loathed architectural form housing\nlarge stores. That is precisely the kind of form that D\u2019Hooghe would like to\nreinvent, to take advantage of its low-cost elements while providing new\naesthetics and better ...", "source": "MIT", "publish_date": "Fri, 29 Mar 2013 05:00:00 +0100", "source_url": "http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/topic/mitarchitecture-rss.xml"}, {"title": "Shared mechanisms in fragile X syndrome, autism and schizophrenia (Medical News Today)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/328266661?count=10&q=leuven&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "summary": "Several psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia, autism and intellectual\ndisabilities share the same brain cell abnormalities: the contacts (synapses)\nbetween brain cells are poorly developed and not functional.
