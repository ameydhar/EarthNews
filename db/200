The green\nsulfur bacterium is perhaps the champion light-harvester. It lives at the\ndepths of the ocean, where light levels are extremely low. But it makes the\nmost of the light it gets: It is able to harvest up to 95% of the solar energy\nit absorbs.\n\n\nResearch teams worldwide are trying to replicate the capabilities of the green\nsulfur bacterium.
