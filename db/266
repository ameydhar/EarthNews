Dubbed the \u201chunger hormone,\u201d ghrelin was quickly targeted\nby drug companies seeking treatments for obesity \u2014 none of which have yet\npanned out.\n\n\nMIT neuroscientists have now discovered that ghrelin\u2019s role goes far beyond\ncontrolling hunger. The researchers found that ghrelin released during chronic\nstress makes the brain more vulnerable to traumatic events, suggesting that it\nmay predispose people to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\n\nDrugs that reduce ghrelin levels, originally developed to try to combat\nobesity, could help protect people who are at high risk for PTSD, such as\nsoldiers serving in war, says Ki Goosens, an assistant professor of brain and\ncognitive sciences at MIT, and senior author of a paper describing the\nfindings in the Oct. 15 online edition of _Molecular Psychiatry_.\n\n\n\u201cPerhaps we could give people who are going to be deployed into an active\ncombat zone a ghrelin vaccine before they go, so they will have a lower\nincidence of PTSD. That\u2019s exciting because right now there\u2019s nothing given to\npeople to prevent PTSD,\u201d says Goosens, who is also a member of MIT\u2019s McGovern\nInstitute for Brain Research.\n\n\nLead author ...", "source": "MIT", "publish_date": "Tue, 15 Oct 2013 09:00:00 +0100", "source_url": "http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/mitresearch-rss.xml"}, {"enclosures": [{"media_type": "image/jpeg", "length": 183435, "uri": "http://media.knoxnews.com/media/img/photos/2013/10/06/media_4d5441ecc11f48dbb3b8db5e3c70bd7c.jpg"}], "author": "Photo by", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/332396925?count=10&q=burgos&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "title": "Andres Burgos, of Foxborough, Mass., top, runs toward Jordan Simpson, 14, of Berlin, Mass., legs onl (Knoxville News Sentinel)", "summary": "Andres Burgos, of Foxborough, Mass., top, runs toward Jordan Simpson, 14, of\nBerlin, Mass., legs only at left, and Jim Kane, of Mansfield, Mass., legs only\nat right, using a prosthetic leg during a running clinic for challenged\nathletes, in Cambridge, Mass., Sunday, Oct. 6, 2013.
