In recent decades, research has shown that many species of these\nunicellular microorganisms can swim, and do so to optimize light exposure,\navoid predators or move closer to others of their kind.\n\n\nNow scientists at MIT and Oxford University have shown that the motility of\nphytoplankton also helps them determine their fate in ocean turbulence. Rather\nthan acting to distribute them evenly \u2014 as physics would demand of small\nparticles mixed into a fluid \u2014 the individual vortices that make up ocean\nturbulence are like social mixers for phytoplankton, bringing similar cells\ninto close proximity, potentially enhancing sexual reproduction and other\necologically desirable activities.\n\n\nIn a paper appearing online July 15 in _Nature Communications_, William Durham\nof Oxford, Roman Stocker of MIT and co-authors describe how at the scale of\nmillimeters, phytoplankton caught in a watery vortex form highly concentrated\npatches at the center of the swirl. In the turbulent ocean where short-lived\nvortices form continually, this process repeats itself, carrying the\nmicroorganisms from social mixer to social ...", "source": "MIT", "publish_date": "Mon, 15 Jul 2013 10:00:00 +0100", "source_url": "http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/topic/mitcivil-engineering-rss.xml"}, {"title": "Airbus versus Boeing Japan battle switches to ANA (Reuters)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/332835916?count=10&q=toulouse&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "summary": "SINGAPORE/TOULOUSE (Reuters) - Stung by the loss of a multi-billion dollar jet\norder from Japan Airlines to arch-rival Airbus , Boeing Co will mount an all-\nout defense of its position with Japan's other major airline, ANA, a source\nclose to the U.S. planemaker said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "source": "Reuters", "publish_date": "Tue, 08 Oct 2013 22:50:00 +0100", "source_url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/businessNews"}, {"title": "UPDATE 1-Airbus versus Boeing Japan battle switches to ANA (Reuters)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/332827829?count=10&q=toulouse&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "summary": "SINGAPORE/TOULOUSE, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Stung by the loss of a multi-billion\ndollar jet order from Japan Airlines to arch-rival Airbus, Boeing Co will\nmount an all-out defence of its position with Japan's other major airline,\nANA, a source close to the U.S. planemaker said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "source": "Reuters", "publish_date": "Tue, 08 Oct 2013 22:46:00 +0100", "source_url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/companyNews"}, {"title": "Interdisciplinary Research on Lymphocyte Motility (Naturejobs)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/333647104?count=10&q=toulouse&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "summary": "A post-doctoral position supported by the French National Research Agency\n(ANR) is available at the beginning of 2014 for 30 months in the group of Lo\u00efc\nDupr\u00e9 (Laboratory Salvatore Valitutti) at the Center for Physiopathology of\nToulouse Purpan, an Institute co-sponsored by INSERM, CNRS and the University\nof Toulouse which is dedicated to basic and translational research in the\nfields of Immunology, Inflammation and Infectious diseases\n(http://www.cptp.inserm.fr/).\n\n\nApproaches combining bi\u2026\n\n", "source": "Naturejobs", "publish_date": "Sat, 12 Oct 2013 10:48:00 +0100", "source_url": "http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/jobs/biologicalsciences.rdf"}, {"title": "\u201cPlay Communs\u201d Combine Papercraft and Electronics Into Simple Robots (MAKE Magazine)", "url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/331945343?count=10&q=toulouse&client_source=api&order=relevance&format=json", "author": "Nick Normal", "source_url": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/makezineonline", "source": "MAKE Magazine", "publish_date": "Fri, 04 Oct 2013 10:18:00 +0100", "summary": "Designed by Toulouse-based design group Ultra Ordinaire, Play Communs \"is a\ntoy for children and adults that aims to bring young and old closer to\nelectronics.\"\n\nRead more on MAKE\n\n"}], "syndication_url": "http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/news.rss?count=10&q=toulouse&client_source=api&order=relevance", "description": "Top News - 'Toulouse'", "title": "Feedzilla: Top News - 'Toulouse'"}
